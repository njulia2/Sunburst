I don\u2019t know what was so funny in this exact moment, but find things (hobbies, experiences, people, etc) in life that make you laugh this hard and keep them close.\n.\n.\n.\nYesterday morning started out at -2 degrees, but it still turned out to be a gorgeous day for a hike up Nineteen Mile Brook & Wildcat Ridge. We stopped at the #carternotchhut to warm up & eat before and after reaching the summit of Wildcat which added some time to our hike. We clocked out for the day at around 10 miles, 8 hours, 32,000 steps, and one more peak crossed off the list.\n.\n.\n.\n\u2705 Wildcat Mountain - Peak A (4422\u2019) # 33 | 48\n.\n.\n.\n#nh48 #hikethewhites #hikenh48 #amc4000footers #appalachiantrail #whitemountains #wmnfhikers #wmnf #optoutdoors #getoutside #getoutsidenh #trailnorth #hikingwmnf #newhampshire #hikenewengland #484kfooters #exploremore #wanderlust #dowhatyoulove #mountains #mountaintherapy"

A new @yoho.co collection is headed to new stockist @campingcampingcamping in Sperryville, Virginia. \nHappy Camper Equipment Co. sits at the base of Shenandoah National Park in this sweet, small southern town, 70 miles outside of Washington DC. \nJust down the street is one of the main entrances to Shenandoah National Park, so Sperryville is  a Mecca for weekend and day trip adventure seekers. \nAlso, one of the East Coast\u2019s most famous hiking destinations, Old Rag, is just steps from Sperryville. The Shenandoah Mountains are famous for the Appalachian Trail and Skyline Drive. It\u2019s an incredibly beautiful part of the world! \nWe\u2019re so excited to have HCECo. join as a new stockist. Their exclusive @yoho.co pennants are on the way and expected to arrive next week. \ud83d\udea9\n.\n.\n.\n#sperryville #virginia #designer #design #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #virginiabeach #virginiaisforlovers #shenandoahnationalpark #shenandoah #oldragmountain #oldrag #skylinedrive #wool #cabininthewoods #cabinlife #adventure #usa #explore  #bears #pennant #pennants",

I\u2019m traveling full-time, so this is a perfect time for him to realize a major bucket list task. I thought I was handling the idea of him being gone quite well. If I was going to get emotional, I thought it would have been when I dropped him off at the #springermountain trailhead or drove from Georgia to Virginia alone. Nope. Nothing until last night, when it finally hit me that he\u2019s likely going to be gone until summer. Welp. Water works. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s going to go by fast. I mean, it feels like we *just* met and that was more than 13 years ago. I would never dream of asking him to come home because I want him to finish possibly almost as much as he does. I\u2019m so happy that he gets to have an adventure. I\u2019m also excited to re-experience some of the things that I enjoyed when I was single. I don\u2019t remember what those things were, but as soon as I do, I\u2019m sure I will be happy to do them again! Matt, if you\u2019re reading this, I miss you so much and I\u2019m so proud of you for making a dream come true!

We spent the last few days in a slice of paradise nestled in the North Georgia Mtns.  Our cabin was at the base of Amicalola Falls. This beautiful area is the start of one of the approach trails  to the Appalachian mountains.  She starts her trek from Georgia to Maine!  God Speed, Friend.  So inspired by her, and I always have been!  Cathi and Andrew have been planning her trip and she has been training for well over a year!!

We begin section hiking the AT. \nThis section was Springer Mountain to Hawk Mountain Shelter and back.  We begin at the Springer Mountain parking lot on a Friday after work, hiking up to the summit of Springer Mountain, capturing our first of many amazing sunsets on the AT.  What a way to end the week and begin an awesome new chapter in the Happy Hiking Couple book. \u2764\ufe0f Saturday we awoke to a frosty ground but our NorthFace Wasatch sleeping bags kept us toasty warm @thenorthface .\n\nThere was a mouse stirring at the Springer Mountain Shelter by our campsite. I screamed.  Poor little thing just wanted some good food.  We cooked up some tasty noodles and salmon. \nSaturday morning we hiked to Hawk Mountain Shelter, stopping along the way at Three Forks and beautiful Long Creek Falls.  We slept very well at Hawk Mountain and hiked back to Springer Mountain parking lot through the rain on Sunday morning. \nLessons learned this week: \u2014Lesson 1\u2014Proper footwear is essential.  Christy lost toenails! Yuck!\ud83e\udd22 \u2014\n\u2014Lesson 2\u2014Because you have a pocket doesn\u2019t mean you have to put something in it.

                                "This is @deucestarmount (Matt) and Alex about 24-25 years ago. Matt has been contemplating #hiking the #appalachiantrail for longer than Alex has been alive. I\u2019m traveling full-time, so this is a perfect time for him to realize a major bucket list task. I thought I was handling the idea of him being gone quite well. If I was going to get emotional, I thought it would have been when I dropped him off at the #springermountain trailhead or drove from Georgia to Virginia alone. Nope. Nothing until last night, when it finally hit me that he\u2019s likely going to be gone until summer. Welp. Water works. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s going to go by fast. I mean, it feels like we *just* met and that was more than 13 years ago. I would never dream of asking him to come home because I want him to finish possibly almost as much as he does. I\u2019m so happy that he gets to have an adventure. I\u2019m also excited to re-experience some of the things that I enjoyed when I was single. I don\u2019t remember what those things were, but as soon as I do, I\u2019m sure I will be happy to do them again! Matt, if you\u2019re reading this, I miss you so much and I\u2019m so proud of you for making a dream come true!

We spent the last few days in a slice of paradise nestled in the North Georgia Mtns.  Our cabin was at the base of Amicalola Falls. This beautiful area is the start of one of the approach trails  to the Appalachian mountains.  She starts her trek from Georgia to Maine!  God Speed, Friend.  So inspired by her, and I always have been!  Cathi and Andrew have been planning her trip and she has been training for well over a year!! She\u2019s amazing, and can always use encouraging thoughts and prayers!  #hikingtheappalachiantrail #appalachiantrail #springermountain #cathimorrisalot #appalachiantrailthruhike2020 #appalachiantrailthruhike",

We begin section hiking the AT. \nThis section was Springer Mountain to Hawk Mountain Shelter and back.  We begin at the Springer Mountain parking lot on a Friday after work, hiking up to the summit of Springer Mountain, capturing our first of many amazing sunsets on the AT.  What a way to end the week and begin an awesome new chapter in the Happy Hiking Couple book. \u2764\ufe0f Saturday we awoke to a frosty ground but our NorthFace Wasatch sleeping bags kept us toasty warm @thenorthface .\n\nThere was a mouse stirring at the Springer Mountain Shelter by our campsite. I screamed.  Poor little thing just wanted some good food.  We cooked up some tasty noodles and salmon. \nSaturday morning we hiked to Hawk Mountain Shelter, stopping along the way at Three Forks and beautiful Long Creek Falls.  We slept very well at Hawk Mountain and hiked back to Springer Mountain parking lot through the rain on Sunday morning. \nLessons learned this week: \u2014Lesson 1\u2014Proper footwear is essential.

We begin section hiking the AT. \nThis section was Springer Mountain to Hawk Mountain Shelter and back.

What a way to end the week and begin an awesome new chapter in the Happy Hiking Couple book. \u2764\ufe0f Saturday we awoke to a frosty ground but our NorthFace Wasatch sleeping bags kept us toasty warm @thenorthface .\n\nThere was a mouse stirring at the Springer Mountain Shelter by our campsite. I screamed.  Poor little thing just wanted some good food.  We cooked up some tasty noodles and salmon. \nSaturday morning we hiked to Hawk Mountain Shelter, stopping along the way at Three Forks and beautiful Long Creek Falls.  We slept very well at Hawk Mountain and hiked back to Springer Mountain parking lot through the rain on Sunday morning. \nLessons learned this week: \u2014Lesson 1\u2014Proper footwear is essential.

I\u2019m traveling full-time, so this is a perfect time for him to realize a major bucket list task. I thought I was handling the idea of him being gone quite well. If I was going to get emotional, I thought it would have been when I dropped him off at the #springermountain trailhead or drove from Georgia to Virginia alone. Nope. Nothing until last night, when it finally hit me that he\u2019s likely going to be gone until summer. Welp. Water works. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s going to go by fast. I mean, it feels like we *just* met and that was more than 13 years ago. I would never dream of asking him to come home because I want him to finish possibly almost as much as he does. I\u2019m so happy that he gets to have an adventure. I\u2019m also excited to re-experience some of the things that I enjoyed when I was single. I don\u2019t remember what those things were, but as soon as I do, I\u2019m sure I will be happy to do them again! Matt, if you\u2019re reading this, I miss you so much and I\u2019m so proud of you for making a dream come true!

We spent the last few days in a slice of paradise nestled in the North Georgia Mtns.  Our cabin was at the base of Amicalola Falls. This beautiful area is the start of one of the approach trails  to the Appalachian mountains.  She starts her trek from Georgia to Maine!  God Speed, Friend.  So inspired by her, and I always have been!  Cathi and Andrew have been planning her trip and she has been training for well over a year!! She\u2019s amazing, and can always use encouraging thoughts and prayers!  #hikingtheappalachiantrail #appalachiantrail #springermountain #cathimorrisalot #appalachiantrailthruhike2020 #appalachiantrailthruhike",

                                "We celebrated 2020 in style, starting the year with our first snowstorm on the trail. For Georgia, it was something else. .\n.\nOur hike was from Gooch Mountain Shelter to Neel Gap. We had the shuttle driver drop us off at Gooch Gap Friday after work.  We hiked up to Gooch Mountain Shelter and were greeted by none other than Happy Down the Trail!  He started his thru hike on January 1st.  It was great to catch up with him before he continued northbound to Katahdin.  Check him out on his YouTube channel.  Truly an awesome guy!  We spent that evening sleeping inside the shelter.  Of course, Pockets thought she was going to be attacked by mice all night! \ud83d\udc01 \ud83d\udc2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 We woke up to light ran on Saturday morning but started our hike toward Neels Gap.  What amazing views we saw at Woody Gap and Preacher\u2019s Rock!  Absolutely stunning!  Once we hit Lance Creek though, white stuff started falling from the sky.  Pockets, being a true southerner, asked what was falling from the trees.  Shart, having grown up in Northern Idaho, knew exactly what that white stuff was. \u2744\ufe0f \u2744\ufe0f By late afternoon, visibility was very low, so we hunkered down at Jarrard Gap. Then commences the snow storm with 25-40 mph winds.  We braved through the night and woke up to a beautiful, winter wonderland. \nSunday morning was cold to begin with but turned out to be a stunning day as we summited Blood Mountain, the highest point on the AT in Georgia.  Pockets even laid down on a rock on Blood Mountain, almost dozing off because it was so relaxing. .\n.\nBlood Mountain is a HUGE tourist attraction. And this day was no different than others. We were following a group of day hikers down the mountain and we got off trail. Pockets, in her wisdom, refused to backtrack because she didn\u2019t want to climb over a rock.  BAD idea!  We ended up cutting trail along the side of Blood Mountain for about 1/2 mile.  Next time she\u2019ll climb that rock!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Always an adventure!\n.\n.\nLessons Learned this Hike:\n**Lesson 1\u2013Don\u2019t cut Trail. Rocks won\u2019t hurt you.  The side of Blood Mountain just might!\n**Lesson 2\u2013Listen to the Trail. \n#happyhiking #happyhikingcouple #happywanderers #appalachiantrail #welovehiking #happyhikers",

Sassafras Mountain was killer, but we made it. We both drank a liter of water once we came into Horse Gap. Poor Don earned his trail name this weekend after eating a ton of Mexican food Friday night at Hawk Mountain Shelter.  I present to you Shart. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 He wasn\u2019t too thrilled about that. .\n.\n.\n.\nLots of fun times this weekend.  It was our first time to meet Happy Down the Trail\u2014a thruhiker\u2014as he was completing his shakedown hike from Damascus. We would see Happy again!  We had an amazing fire that night. We also met some SOBO thru hikers completing their journey from Maine, a grandfather who has thru hiked twice and his 4 grandsons, and a young guy from the Dominican hiking a longer section.  This is part of what we love about Trail\u2014the community. .\n.\n.\nSaturday was overcast but nice. Sassafras was no joke!  We spent Saturday evening at the shelter with the grandfather and 4 grandsons.  It was raining, so we slept in the shelter...first time ever.  Pockets was freaking out, scared mice would get her all night. The boys played jokes on her all night. \ud83d\udc01 \ud83d\udc2d Truly fun times! .\n.\n.\nLessons learned:\n1.  Not all rain gear is equal. Our rain gear was like sauna suits. \n2.  Always sleep with your head facing out in a shelter because mice run around the corners.  Thanks, Grandpa!\n3.  Don\u2019t eat Mexican 3 straight days unless you want to earn the trail name Shart. \n4.
